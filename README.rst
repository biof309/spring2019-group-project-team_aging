We create a script to read a SAM file, filter and trim reads, and write a clean output FASTA file.


Description
===========

We got a uBAM file generated by the sequencing of a PCR sample. In the process of the analysis the uBAM was converted to SAM-format.
The SAM file contains all sorts of reads with various lengths, presence or not of the PCR primers (complete and incomplete sequences), forward and reverse reads, and junk reads.
We want to generate a FASTA file that contains only the complete region of interest in a certain range of lenghts.
